[Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) Express online app called Yelpcamp

This app was created via a tutorial where I learned and wrote the application via codealong, therefore I take no ownership for it's design or implementation. It served as a very good tutorial for teaching me Javascript, Node, Express, Mongo and Mongoose and learning about RESTful routes, Authentication and Authorization. A link to the app is below.
